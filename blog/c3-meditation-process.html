                <h5> How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way I tackled the redesign and rebuild of my site?</h5>
                <p>I think it's a good way of looking at the design side of this at the moment.  You could sepnd sooo many hours on this changing the layout, fonts, colours, images etc so its good to be able to just go ok this is functional i can leave it for now</p>     
                <h5>What di you think about meditation before readingchapter 2?</h5>
                <p>I liked the idea of meditation to clear your mind.  I have used it in the past to help get to sleep and have found it works really well.</p>
                <h5>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h5>
                <p>That its not just about being relaxed it has an ephasis on you also being alert. I liked the analogy with physical activity and how its training your mind.</p>
                <h5>Meditation techniques that stood out?</h5>
                <p>The extended mindfulness seems like my preferred option.</p>
