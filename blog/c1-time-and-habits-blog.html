    <h1>Time and habit techniques</h1>
    <h2>What timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>
    <p>Fogg method. The counterintuitive ways to be productive.</p>
    <h2>What did you find interesting?</h2>
    <p>The tedTalk by BJ Fogg about tiny habits.  It was very interesting is very achievable to complete tasks by breaking them into smaller tasks.  ALso i like the idea of using existing habits as a trigger to start a new habit.  The article about the habits of successful people was also good and compliments the tedtalk.  I liked that they suggested by starting small you can produce something great.</p>
    <h2>What worked for you?</h2>
    <p>Allowing myself less time for tasks so that i am more productive.  Thinking about more small habits i could create to help me through this course.</p>
    <h2>Which will you experiment further with?</h2>
    <p>I'm quite keen to try the pomodoro technique.  It seems like it's quite a structured way of time management which would be beneficial for me. I also think that i might give the meditation a go in my breaks.</p>
