                <h3>How does Javascript compare to html and css?</h3>
                <p>Html and Css make a website have content, structure and look good.  Javascript uses makes a website interactive and can run more complicated behind the scene checks on data.</p>
                <h3>Explain control flow and loops</h3>
                <p>Control flow is when you use a statement to run a code based on certain conditions that you give it. Loops repeat codes over and over so you dont have to keep writing the same code.</p>
                <h3>Explain accessing data from arrays and objects</h3>
                <p>You can access all sorts of data from arrays as it is just a list made up of whatever fields you want to put into it. Each data type that you put in will have a numbered order to help you write different code using the array.  Objects contain data and data functions which we can access using a key that we call a data type when entered.</p>
                <h3>Explain functions</h3>
                <p>Codeacademy refer to functions as being like a recipe which is a really good way to put it.  When you write code in a certain way the functions will produce the desired outcome.</p>
