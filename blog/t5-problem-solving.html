                <h3>A time when i got blocked on a simple problem?</h3>
                <p>I'v had a few times where i have just missed one thing in a line of code so it wasnt working.  Sometimes i would try to look over the material i was given but mostly i would just go over again and again looking at my code and all the components because i was sure it was just something i had done wrong.  It made me feel frustrated not nkowing what to do. I learnt that 99% of the time it's because i haven't written the code properly (ie. added an s at the end of the word or missed something that is part of the syntax) so not to blame other factors and just keep checking my code!</p>
                <h3>Confidence in problem solving teechniques and process?</h3>
                <p>I am mostly confident with asking perrs for help,trying something, googling and pseuodocode. I am ok with reading error messages, console logging, rubber ducky method, asking coaches for help and improving process with relfection but i could definitley spend some more time practising these things.</p>
                <h3>Functions</h3>
                <p>.map() creates a new array by using the results and calling on the elemets in the new array.</p>
                <p>.filter() creates a new array with all the elements that are correct for the test which the funation provides.</p>
                <p>.reduce() starts the callback function for every element present in the array.</p>
