                <h5>What I learnt from the 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h5>
                <p>I learnt that it takes quite  a lot of awareness to concentrate on someone else talking without responding for 4 minutes.  The other person thought it was good and having the hmm and nodding helps a lot so you are still engaging with the person.</p>
                <h5>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h5>
                <p>I might start with the taking one breath a day as that seems the most achieveable.  Then maybe move onto the having a buddy.</p>
                <h5>Any other musings?</h5>
                <p>Walking Meditation seems like a really good thing to do when you need to have a break from study.</p>
