                <h5>What is scope and how does it work in javascript?</h5>
                <p>In Javascript there are two different types of Scope.  Global scope and local scope.</p>
                <p>Global scope contains variables that apply to the whole document that you are creating.</p>
                <p>Local scope are variables within a function and only apply to that function.  If you ran something in that local scope it would not apply to all the other functions that you have written.</p>
                <p>A really good analogy of global and local scope that i read is that every country has a border that contains that country's scope.  Within that country's scope there are cities and they have their own scope too.  </p>
