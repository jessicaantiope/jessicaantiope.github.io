                <h5>What is a responsive site and why is responsiveness important?</h5>
                <p>A responsive site is a site that can adapt to whatever screen size you have.  It is really important because we all use many different devices such as laptops, tablets and phones.  Making a site that is responsive means that on all these devices you are still able to see and use the content easily.</p>
                <h5>What is mobile first design and why is it important?</h5>
                <p>Mobile first design is the idea that you should start building your site for mobiles and then build up to the desktop stage instead of the other way around.  It's easier to scale up that to scale down from an established site. It's important because so many people are using mobile devices and sites need to be readily accessible for everyone.</p>
                <h5>What are frameworks and their pros and cons?</h5>
                <p>Frameworks are a set of standardised code to help you keep some elements on your site in line with common concepts and problems.  They can be a really big help to make the process faster for you, compatibilty and they also give you some clean code that is already doen for you.  However because they give you the code already written it means that you arent really how to do all of these things yourself so you might get stuck further down the line if you were relying on frameworks.</p>
                <h5>What is a wireframe and why do we use it?</h5>
                <p>A wireframe is a basic idea around how you want a site to look. You can draw this on paper or use a wireframing software. It takes away all the "fancy" elements of a website like colour, design and content and is more of a building block as to what, where and how you need to design your site.  They are really useful at giving you a visual on how your site might look without being distracted by images etc.</p>
                <h5>Which aspects of my wireframes did i find difficult?</h5>
                <p>I really struggled with the image. Sometimes it was just a simple thing link i had altered the link but other times it was about setting the margins and making it go exactly where i wanted it to! </p>
