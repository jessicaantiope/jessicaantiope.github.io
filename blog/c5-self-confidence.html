                <h5>What is the relationship bewteen mindfulness and self awareness?</h5>
                <p>Mindfulness relates to being able to bring your attention back after it naturally drifts away and having a focus on the inforation you are recieveing from aother or yourself.  Self-confidence is about having a self understanding about our own strengths and weaknesses and accessing our inner wisdom.</p>
                <h5>What was your experience of either the body scan or journaling? How did you feel?</h5>
                <p>The body scan was very relaxing.  I found myself focussed through it but it als made me very calm.</p>
                <h5>What did you take away from the "My emotions are not me" section?</h5>
                <p>That sometimes we can get caught up in being an emotion such as being angry or sad however we are FEELING those emotions.  Mindfulness practice helps to change our views on being an emotion feeling an emotion which ends up making it easier to deal with or respond to.</p>
