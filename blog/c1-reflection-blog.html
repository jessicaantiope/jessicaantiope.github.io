    <h1>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h1>
    <p>The experience has a very differnt style of learning which is engaging and offers different resources for different learning styles which is great. The way phase 0 is set up i find is really organised and easy to find the information that you are after.  Belonging to a cohort is really helpful as everyone is in the same boat and very supportive of one another.</p>
    <h1>What are your impressions?</h1>
    <p>So far so good.  I think its exciting but can also make you a little bit nervous when there is something that you think is too hard</p>
    <h1>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h1>
    <p>I'm really looking forward to it.  I liked the kitchen mindset analogy that every is in this as a team regardless of where their strengths lie.</p>
    <h1>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h1>
    <p>Not really I knew coming into this it would be an engaging and intense course.</p>
    <h1>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h1>
    <p>Yup, really excited about this learning environment! I wouldn't say the learning environment makes me nervous but I'm a little nervous about keeping up with the workload.</p>
