            <p>HTML is like your bookshelf.  It is structural and hokds everthing together.  CSS is like your books.  It makes your bookshelf look nice and easy to find things.  DOM is like your librarian.  It can help move things around and make sure everything is in place. </p>
            <p>A website is made up of many boxes.  Boxifying design means to look at a webpage and divide it into the boxes that are on it.</p>
            <p>The box model is used in CSS and wraps around html.  The term contains the content, padding, border and margins.  It helps us to add borders and spaces between some of the elements that we have on a webpage.  </p>
